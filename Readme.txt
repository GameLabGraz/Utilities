1. Import the VR Interaction Plugin (SteamVR is already included there, but you may need the Oculus Integration Package too).

2. Copy the actions (the whole content of the folder VR Interaction Plugin\SteamVR_GEAR_VRInteraction\1\) into your project's SteamVR-Folder (YourProject\Assets\StreamingAssets\SteamVR\).

3. Go to "Window > SteamVR Input" and click "Save and generate" to actually generate the actions.

4. It can occur that your actions are not yet mapped to buttons on your controller, you can check this via "Window > Steam VR Input" clicking "Open bindung UI" and check your current bindings.

Please also make sure that SteamVR and Steam are started.
